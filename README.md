# Footballfield_CIP2025
Football Field created for CIP 2025 project 

I created a replica of a football field along with showcasing a person on the field kicking a football through the goalposts. 

Built completely in Python using a simplified version of Tkinter (Note: created within the Code in Place IDE graphics environment which is built on top of tkinter). The link is provided below to the final project. 

This is the final project for Stanford University Code In Place 2025.
