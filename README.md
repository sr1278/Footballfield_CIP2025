# Footballfield_CIP2025
Football Field created for CIP 2025 project 

I created a replica of a football field along with showcasing a person on the field kicking a football through the goalposts. 

Built completely in Python using Tkinter (Note: created within the Code in Place IDE graphics environment). The link is provided below to the final project. 


This is the final project for Stanford University Code In Place 2025.
